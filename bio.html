<h1>Benjamin Kingsland Leiken</h1>
<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>Hi there! Call me Ben -- I'm a junior at Tufts, majoring in Computer Science, with minors in Entrepreneurship and Philosophy. 

<p>I'm especially interested in Software Engineering and Project Management internships at tech firms and startups for this upcoming summer!

<p>I've been doing iOS development in Objective-C for a few years now. I'm on the programming end of a mobile speech therapy iOS app called Speech4Good (www.speech4good.com), which I run with a friend of mine at Tufts. 
<p>I won the Tufts Hackathon last spring for a project I worked on with a friend called LiveNote, a time-stamped note-taking web application for taking notes on films, lectures, or anything where the timing is important. 
<p>I have several years of experience working in both C and C++. I am especially proficient in C, thanks to a Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming course here at Tufts, where I completed such projects as building a virtual machine, writing an image compressor/decompressor, and programming a Sudoku solution checker â€“ all in C.
<p>I have experience with (and enjoy!) pair and team programming. Half of my CS classes at Tufts have required one or both and all of my outside projects have been pair ventures. 
<p>I am proficient with Git and revision control as well.
